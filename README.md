# Advance RAG Systems

Advance RAG Systems is a collection of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) projects and research notebooks exploring advanced retrieval strategies for large language models (LLMs). This repository demonstrates why relying solely on semantic (vector-based) search is often insufficient, and highlights the benefits of hybrid and graph-based retrieval approaches for robust, interpretable, and context-rich question answering.

## Why Not Just Semantic Search?

Semantic search, powered by embeddings and vector similarity, has revolutionized information retrieval by enabling LLMs to find contextually relevant passages even when keywords don’t match exactly. However, **semantic search alone has limitations**:

- **Misses Exact Matches:** Sometimes, precise keyword matches (e.g., technical terms, names, numbers) are crucial and may be overlooked by embeddings.
- **Lacks Interpretability:** Vector search results are often hard to explain, making it difficult to trace why a passage was retrieved.
- **Context Fragmentation:** Semantic similarity may retrieve isolated chunks that are contextually similar but not structurally related, leading to incomplete answers.
- **Fails on Out-of-Distribution Queries:** Embeddings may not generalize well to rare or domain-specific queries.

## Why Hybrid Search?

**Hybrid search** combines the strengths of both semantic (vector) and traditional keyword (BM25, TF-IDF) retrieval:

- **Precision + Recall:** Keyword search ensures exact matches, while semantic search finds contextually similar passages.
- **Robustness:** Handles a wider range of queries, including those with typos, synonyms, or rare terms.
- **Improved Coverage:** Increases the likelihood of retrieving all relevant information for complex or multi-faceted questions.
- **Better User Experience:** Hybrid systems can rank and blend results, providing more accurate and useful answers.

## Why Graph Search?

**Graph-based retrieval** (GraphRAG) goes beyond both semantic and hybrid search by leveraging the structure and relationships within your data:

- **Captures Relationships:** Graphs model entities and their connections, enabling multi-hop reasoning and complex query answering.
- **Contextual Navigation:** Allows traversal along relationship paths, supporting queries that require understanding of how concepts are linked.
- **Explainability:** Graph queries (e.g., Cypher) provide transparent, interpretable retrieval paths.
- **Dynamic Knowledge:** Graphs can be updated and expanded as new information is extracted, supporting evolving knowledge bases.
